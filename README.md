# Ai Real-Time Prank Weather Project

## Overview

This project is a prank weather forecast application that mimics a real-time weather forecast but provides humorous and nonsensical responses instead.

## Features

- **Realistic UI**: The application features a clean and modern user interface designed to resemble a real-time weather forecast application.
- **Location Input**: Users can input their location using a text input field.
- **Processing Animation**: When a user submits their location, a processing popup with a progress bar appears, mimicking the process of fetching weather data.
